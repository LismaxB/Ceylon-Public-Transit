# 🌍 Ceylon Public Transit - Open Source Bus Location Tracker 🚍

Welcome to **Ceylon Public Transit**, an open-source initiative aimed at revolutionizing public transport for the people of Sri Lanka! Our project aims to provide real-time bus tracking, making your daily commute smoother and more efficient. With a **Driver App** and a **Client Web Application**, we're building the future of public transit with the help of the open-source community. 🌟
