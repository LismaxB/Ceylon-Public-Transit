## Security Best Practices

While developing and contributing to the project, we encourage everyone to follow these security best practices:

- **Avoid exposing sensitive information** such as API keys, tokens, or other credentials in the codebase.
- Ensure that any **third-party libraries** used in the project are regularly updated to mitigate potential security risks.
- Handle user inputs carefully to avoid **injection attacks** such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Always use **secure authentication mechanisms** and ensure proper encryption for sensitive data.
